Run `make` to make the jar file with all the laser turtle libraries. 

Run `make example` and then `java -cp laserTurtle.jar:. ExampleLaserTurtle` to run the example. It should draw a triangle.

`make snowflake` followed by `java -cp laserTurtle.jar:. SnowflakeTurtle` will run the snowflake example (which draws a fractal snowflake).
